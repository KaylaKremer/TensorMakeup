# TensorShade ✋🏻✋✋🏽✋🏿
A machine learning app that uses Tensorflow, React, and Parcel to best match makeup foundation shades from various beauty brands to images of skin tones.

I used the dataset from @the-pudding for their [*Beauty Brawl*](https://pudding.cool/2018/06/makeup-shades/) essay published in June 2018, which explores how inclusive beauty brands are around the world.
