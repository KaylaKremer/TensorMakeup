# TensorShade ✋🏻✋✋🏽✋🏿
A machine learning app that uses Tensorflow, React, and Parcel to best match makeup foundation shades from various beauty brands to images of skin tones.

I used the dataset from [@the-pudding](@the-pudding) for their [*Beauty Brawl*](https://pudding.cool/2018/06/makeup-shades/) essay published in June 2018, which explores how inclusive beauty brands are around the world.

To run TensorShade, simply clone or fork this repo, then `cd` into the project folder and type `npm start` in your terminal to build and deploy the app in the browser.

Alternatively, you can view the deployed app here: [https://tensorshade.kaylakremer.now.sh/](https://tensorshade.kaylakremer.now.sh/)
